Excleexpert 
I am a Chinese lady, a mom of 2 very cute sons, a wife of hard worker husband. I had been as accountant for 12 years in China before I move to USA. I am very good at number and excle software. 
I want to work after my sons go to school, and make some money to help my husband. 
I can work on daytime, USA east-time from 9:45pm -- 3:45 pm from Monday to Friday.
